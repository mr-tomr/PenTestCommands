# Writable Directories in Windows (Ordered by Likelihood)

In a standard Windows environment, certain directories are writable by all users (Everyone). These directories are limited for security reasons, but some common writable directories include:

| Directory Path                              | Description                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `C:\Users\Public\`                          | Designed for sharing files between users on the same machine. Subdirectories like `Public Documents`, `Public Downloads`, `Public Music`, `Public Pictures`, and `Public Videos` are also writable by all users. |
| `C:\Windows\Temp\`                          | The `Temp` directory under `C:\Windows\` is typically writable by all users and is used for temporary files by both the system and applications. |
| `C:\ProgramData\`                           | Some subdirectories under `ProgramData`, especially those related to certain application settings, might be writable by all users. |
| `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\` | Internet cache files are often writable by all users, depending on specific configurations and application behavior. |
