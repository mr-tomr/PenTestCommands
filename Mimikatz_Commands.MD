Purpose: Mimikatz is primarily used for extracting plaintext passwords, hashes, PINs, and Kerberos tickets from memory. Itâ€™s widely recognized for its capability to interact with the Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) and extract sensitive credentials directly.
Key Features:

    Credential Dumping: Extracts credentials from LSASS memory, including plaintext passwords, NTLM hashes, and Kerberos tickets.
    Pass-the-Hash: Allows the use of NTLM hashes to authenticate without knowing the plaintext password.
    Pass-the-Ticket: Uses Kerberos tickets extracted from memory to authenticate to resources.
    Golden/Silver Ticket Attacks: Creates forged Kerberos tickets that can be used to persist in an environment.
    Other Modules: Mimikatz includes additional modules for things like privilege escalation, process manipulation, and password dumping from various stores like DPAPI and LSA secrets.

Use Case: Typically used in post-exploitation scenarios to dump credentials from a compromised machine and facilitate lateral movement within a network.
