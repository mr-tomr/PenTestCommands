dnsenum --noreverse -o mydomain.xml example.com

We can also use DNSENUM to scrap the sub domains of a website from Google. For doing this we need to type below command :

./dnsenum.pl -p 1 -s 1 example.com

Scrapping will not work on those websites which do not have sub domains and for websites which have restricted wild card scrapping.

That’s all for today. You can practice multiple combinations and sub commands mentioned below to extract juicy information regarding DNS’s for any domain.
