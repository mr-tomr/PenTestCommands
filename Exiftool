Use exiftool to read detailed file attributes/metadata, as well as to write information.

Sometimes used in shell uploads, where file types have to be obfuscated.  
In this example, it will add a php web shell command string to the file.
PHP does not care about the rest of the file, it only looks for the <??> to execute it.
