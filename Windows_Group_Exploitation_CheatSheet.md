| **Rank** | **Group Name**                          | **Direct Exploitability** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                         | **Example Exploit** (Known PoC)                                                                                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | `Domain Admins`                         | Very High                 | Members of this group have full control over the domain, including all domain controllers and computers in the domain. It's the most powerful group in a Windows domain. | **Pass-the-Hash, DCSync**: Full domain compromise (PoC: [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz), [DCSync](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1729))        |
| 2        | `Enterprise Admins`                     | Very High                 | Members can perform administrative tasks across all domains in a forest. It's highly privileged and targeted in attacks.                                                | **Pass-the-Hash, Golden Ticket**: Cross-domain compromise (PoC: [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz))    |
| 3        | `Schema Admins`                         | Very High                 | Members can modify the Active Directory schema. Although less commonly targeted, compromising this group can have catastrophic consequences.                            | **Schema Modification**: Permanent AD changes (PoC: [N/A], typically custom exploitation)                             |
| 4        | `Domain Controllers`                    | Very High                 | This group includes all domain controllers, which are the heart of AD. Compromising a DC gives control over the entire domain.                                          | **DC Shadow, DCSync**: Full domain compromise (PoC: [DCShadow](https://github.com/Cobbr/PSDCShadow))                  |
| 5        | `Administrators`                        | Very High                 | The local Administrators group on each machine within the domain. Members have full control over local resources.                                                       | **Token Manipulation, Pass-the-Hash**: Local SYSTEM privileges (PoC: [Pass-the-Hash](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit))                           |

This can be exploited to gain further control over a system.                              | **Service Exploitation**: SYSTEM-level access (PoC: Custom service exploitation)                                      |
| 7        | `Account Operators`                     | High                      | Members can create, delete, and modify accounts in the domain, excluding administrative accounts. They can be used to create new privileged accounts.                  | **Privilege Escalation**: Create admin account (PoC: Custom based on AD configuration)                                |

This can be exploited to access or overwrite sensitive files like the SAM database.               | **SAM Hive Extraction**: Copy sensitive files (PoC: [BackupOperator](https://github.com/Hackndo/BackupOperator))       |
| 9        | `Remote Desktop Users`                  | High                      | Members can remotely access the system, which can be exploited for lateral movement and further privilege escalation in a networked environment.                         | **Credential Stealing, RDP Hijacking**: Access to remote systems (PoC: [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz))                    |
| 10       | `Power Users`                           | High                      | Historically, this group had significant privileges, including installing software and managing system settings. On newer systems, it's less powerful but still risky.  | **DLL Injection, Registry Editing**: Moderate system control (PoC: Custom DLL injection tools)                        |
| 11       | `Print Operators`                       | Medium                    | Members can manage printers, which may include the ability to install printer drivers or execute code in the context of SYSTEM if a vulnerable driver is exploited.     | **Driver Exploitation**: SYSTEM-level access (PoC: [CVE-2021-1675 (PrintNightmare)](https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675))                               |
| 12       | `Authenticated Users`                   | Medium                    | Members are authenticated users with access to certain system resources. This group can be used for broad reconnaissance or to exploit misconfigurations.               | **Privilege Escalation via Misconfigurations**: Explore accessible resources (PoC: Custom based on context)            |
| 13       | `Local Service`                         | Medium                    | Runs services with minimum privileges, but service misconfigurations could be exploited to escalate privileges.                                                          | **Service Exploitation**: Escalate to SYSTEM (PoC: [MS16-032](https://github.com/foxglovesec/RottenPotato))            |
