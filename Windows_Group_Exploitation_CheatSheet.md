| **Rank** | **Group Name**                          | **Direct Exploitability** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                         | **Example Exploit** (Known PoC)                                                                                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | `BUILTIN\Administrators`                | Very High                 | Members of this group have almost unlimited access to system resources. It is highly sought after for privilege escalation as it grants full administrative control.     | **Token Manipulation, Pass-the-Hash**: Direct access to SYSTEM privileges (PoC: [Pass-the-Hash](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit))   |
| 2        | `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`                   | Very High                 | The SYSTEM account has the highest level of privileges on a Windows system. Gaining access to this account is the ultimate goal of many privilege escalation attacks.    | **Service Exploitation**: Exploit services running under SYSTEM (PoC: [MS16-032](https://github.com/foxglovesec/RottenPotato))                |
| 3        | `BUILTIN\Remote Desktop Users`          | High                      | Members can remotely access the system, which can be exploited for lateral movement and further privilege escalation in a networked environment.                         | **Credential Stealing, RDP Hijacking**: Access to remote systems (PoC: [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz))                    |
| 4        | `BUILTIN\Backup Operators`              | High                      | Members can back up and restore files, bypassing file system security. This can be exploited to access or overwrite sensitive files like the SAM database.               | **SAM Hive Extraction**: Copy sensitive files (PoC: [BackupOperator](https://github.com/Hackndo/BackupOperator))       |
| 5        | `BUILTIN\Power Users`                   | High                      | Historically, this group had significant privileges, including installing software and managing system settings. On newer systems, it's less powerful but still risky.  | **DLL Injection, Registry Editing**: Moderate system control (PoC: Custom DLL injection tools)                        |
| 6        | `NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users`      | Medium                    | Members are authenticated users with access to certain system resources. This group can be used for broad reconnaissance or to exploit misconfigurations.               | **Privilege Escalation via Misconfigurations**: Explore accessible resources (PoC: Custom based on context)            |
| 7        | `NT AUTHORITY\Local Service`            | Medium                    | Runs services with minimum privileges, but service misconfigurations could be exploited to escalate privileges.                                                          | **Service Exploitation**: Escalate to SYSTEM (PoC: [MS16-032](https://github.com/foxglovesec/RottenPotato))            |
| 8        | `NT AUTHORITY\Network Service`          | Medium                    | Runs services that access network resources, potentially exploitable for lateral movement or escalating to SYSTEM.                                                       | **Service Exploitation**: Network attacks (PoC: [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato))                   |
| 9        | `BUILTIN\Users`                         | Medium                    | General user group with limited privileges, but could be used as a stepping stone in privilege escalation, especially if combined with weak permissions or misconfigurations. | **Privilege Escalation via Misconfigurations**: Explore accessible resources (PoC: Custom based on context)          |
| 10       | `BUILTIN\Performance Monitor Users`     | Medium                    | Members can monitor performance counters, potentially allowing them to gather sensitive information or exploit specific monitoring tools.                               | **Information Disclosure**: Access system performance data (PoC: Custom based on context)                               |
| 11       | `NT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES`               | Medium                    | Represents all services running under the service accounts. Misconfigurations or service exploitation could lead to privilege escalation.                                | **Service Exploitation**: Escalate to SYSTEM (PoC: [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato))                |
| 12       | `CONSOLE LOGON`                         | Low                       | Indicates that the user is logged on to the console. Not typically exploitable for privilege escalation.                                                                 | Not exploitable for privilege escalation.                                         |
| 13       | `LOCAL`                                 | Low                       | Represents all users logged on to the computer locally. Not typically exploitable for privilege escalation.                                                              | Not exploitable for privilege escalation.                                         |
| 14       | `NT AUTHORITY\This Organization`        | Low                       | Typically used in enterprise environments. Generally not exploitable for privilege escalation.                                                                           | Not exploitable for privilege escalation.                                         |
| 15       | `Mandatory Label\High Mandatory Level`  | Low                       | Used for Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC). Generally not directly exploitable for privilege escalation, but may influence attack paths in specific scenarios.           | Not exploitable for privilege escalation.                                         |
| 16       | `Everyone`                              | Low                       | Represents all users and authenticated entities. Generally not exploitable, but could be involved in broader security misconfigurations.                                 | Not exploitable for privilege escalation.                                         |
