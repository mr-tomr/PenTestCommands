Expresso

The .NET framework provides a powerful class Regex for creating and using Regular Expressions. While regular expressions are a powerful way to parse, edit, and replace text, the complex syntax makes them hard to understand and prone to errors, even for the experienced user. When developing code that uses regular expressions, I have found it very helpful to create and debug my expressions in a separate tool to avoid time consuming compile/debug cycles. Expresso enables me to do the following:

Build complex regular expressions by selecting components from a palette

Test expressions against real or sample input data

Display all matches in a tree structure showing captured groups, and all captures within a group

Build replacement strings and test the match and replace functionality

Highlight matched text in the input data

Automatically test for syntax errors

Generate Visual Basic or C# code that can be incorporated directly into programs

Read or save regular expressions and input data
